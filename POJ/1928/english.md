## Solution

The problem was solved a year ago but I forgot to put it on the blog. This problem is similar to <a href="/codes/?oj=NOIP&pid=2004J2">NOIP 2004J2</a>. Just pay attention to the larger data range and the variable <data value="v{n}"></data> and <data value="v{m}"></data> have exchanged their places though it doesn't matter.
