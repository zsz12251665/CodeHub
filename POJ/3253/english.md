## Solution

The problem equals to <a href="/codes/?oj=NOIP&pid=2004S2">NOIP 2004J2</a> in form. The idea and the algorithm are the same. The only difference is the data range, which you might need 64-bit integer in this problem.

P. S. The compiler of Pascal is still dead so the Pascal Code remains unverified.
