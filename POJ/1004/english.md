# POJ 1004

## Description

- [Virtual Judge](https://vjudge.net/problem/POJ-1004)
- [POJ](http://poj.org/problem?id=1004)

## Solution

I spent 15 minutes reading the description, getting confused of what it asked for. Then I found it totally a piece of cake for any programmer when I saw the input and output. It just asks me to print the average of 12 real numbers.

## Code
