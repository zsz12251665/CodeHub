## Solution

This problem can be solved recursively. Obviously we can know the number on it if the block is at the border of the square. But if it is not, we can take over the border, adding the answer with <data value="c{4}o{}o{(}v{n}o{-}c{1}o{)}"></data> until it is at the border. So the problem is solved.
