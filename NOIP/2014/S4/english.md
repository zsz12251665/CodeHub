## Solution

This problem is a enumeration problem because we are required to count the number of the best solutions as soon as we find the best solution. As it is not a big city, we can enumerate every points as the transmitter and check if it is one of the best solutions. But do not forget to avoid crossing the index limit while counting the public places!
