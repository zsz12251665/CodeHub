# NOIP 2005J2

## Solution

Well, I know that the description looks that it requires a segment tree to solve. But it actually doesn't. It is just a simulation problem. You just need an array to keep whether there is a tree at the point and cut the ones in the interval down. In the end, count the number of the trees left.
