## Solution

As we know, an invalid bracket sequence must have at least 1 right bracket before its left bracket if the numbers of the brackets match. So to solve this problem we just need to scan the sequence and check that whether the numbers of the brackets match and whether there is at most 1 right bracket before its left bracket so that we could move it to the right place.
