## Solution

In my opinion, this problem is even easier than [CF 1325A](/CF/1325/A/english.md). The answer is the number of different numbers in the array. This is because it was copied $n$ times so that you can choose one number in each copy. And the sequence should be strictly increasing so you cannot choose the number with the same value.
