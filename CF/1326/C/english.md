## Solution

The maximum possible partition value is <data value="o{&sum;}i{v{n}l{}v{i}o{=}v{n}o{-}v{k}o{+}c{1}}v{i}"></data>. It can be found when each segment contains exactly one of the $k$ maximum numbers. Then the problem can be translated to the same as [CF 617B](/CF/617/B/english.md), which calculate the number of ways to break the permutation.
